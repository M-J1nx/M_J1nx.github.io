### What's Git&Github

Git : Software or tool to manage code. To use git, you should install software calling Git at your local environment.

Github : Storage to save code online. You can cooperate with other people by using github. 

However, Git is CLI(Command Line Interface), managing code through command like terminal, It can take time to get used to CLI environment for people who are not familier with CLI environment.

Therefore, if you are not used to CLI environment, and want to use git real quick, I recommend using **Github Desktop**.

To use git&github, we need three things below based on sumption you already have code editor such as visual studio code.

1. git ([git download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
2. Sign up for github ([github homepage](https://github.com/github))
3. github desktop ([github desktop download](https://desktop.github.com/))

### Base concept of git 

1. **Branch** : Location of current work & Stem of work

![Branch has created and Stem of work exists ](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8a656925-fc0e-4de1-9947-61a6517e8bb1/b1a63d6c-f42d-4510-8cea-b31d72fd206d/image.png)

Branch has created and Stem of work exists 

There is concept called **Branch** at git.

You can manage your work like one tree has many branches. Each branch's workspace is independent, and branches can't affect one another.

If main stem of the project is stem in the middle(It normally called as **master branch**.), you can make branches not to effect master branch whenever you need. 

Therefore, if you start new job in green branch, it doesn't effect main branch or purple branch. 


2. **Merge** : Combine branches  

We have master branch, which means main work, and work by dividing branches. We normally release master branch as total service, so if you want to update function of released service, you should update your new works in master branch.

We update new works by combining branches into mater branch in git.

We call combining action as **merge**. 

â€» Merge is possible action not only for branches and mater branch, but also for branches each other.

3. **Commit** : Checkpoint of works  

When you are working, there will be changes. You may want to save those changed states at somewhere and keep working.

In this case, we can make checkpoint of work by commiting our works to git.

When you commit your works while you working in branch, works at commited point updated to branch, and we can use this as checkpoint. 

In other words, you can revert branch's state as you want.

4. **Repository** : Storage of the work 

We update works by commit, combine works by merge, manage work by branch.

The place where we saving our works called repository, and we usually call this as **repo** in short.

Repository can be local floder in your computer, and it also can be online storage like github.

### Works of git

- push
    
    Work at local environment, When you commit your work, and you want to see it in online through github, you should **push** the work. It update commited work in online.
    
- pull
    
    When you work in local computer, and if you want to get working repository's state, you should **pull** the work. Think pulling repository to your local computer.
    
    When you work with other people at github, online, and if you want to get other people's work, you can pull the repository (In this case, other people's work should be pushed to repository you can work).
    
- pull request
    
    This suggests combining changed code into original code. In other word, asking before combine changed code.
    
    Normally, this stage should be taken before merge into master branch.
