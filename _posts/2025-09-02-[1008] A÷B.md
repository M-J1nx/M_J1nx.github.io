## Problem

After receiving the two integers A and B, write a program that outputs A/B.

## Input

A and B are given in the first line. (0 < A, B < 10)

## Output

Print A/B on the first line. If the absolute or relative error between the actual correct answer and the output value is 10-9 or less, it is the correct answer.

# Answer

---

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	double a, b = 0;
	cin >> a >> b;
	printf("%.9lf", a / b);
	return 0;
}
```

If normally using `cout` , there is an error even if using `cout.precision(9);`. The problem means to print out 9 significant digits, which is not 9 digits below the decimal point, so it may be wrong in solving the problem. We can do `cout << fixed << setprecision(9) <<a/b <<endl;` but I went with the simple way.
